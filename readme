A hopefully somewhat SUCKLESS utility inspired by the masterpieces "CatgirlDownloader" and "WaifuDownloader"
What this utility should do:
	Flags:
		-n             | --nsfw              = retrieve nsfw images
		-p param value | --param param valye = add a parameter if the endpoint supports it
		-e endpoint    | --endpoint endpoint = retrieve from {endpoint}
	Endpoint integration:
		This utility is designed to be able to retrieve most images from most APIs. To archieve this,
there should be a file that dictates which endpoints are usable and how to use them (config.def.h and
config.h).
