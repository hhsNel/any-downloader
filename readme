A hopefully somewhat SUCKLESS utility inspired by the masterpieces "CatgirlDownloader" and "WaifuDownloader"
What this utility should do:
	Flags:
		-c count       | --count count       = try to retrieve {count} images at a time
		-n             | --nsfw              = retrieve nsfw images
		-N             | --no-nsfw           = turn nsfw off
		-p param value | --param param valye = add a parameter if the endpoint supports it
		-e endpoint    | --endpoint endpoint = retrieve from {endpoint}
                -d             | --display           = after retrieving image, show it on console
                -D             | --no-display        = do not show image on console
                -f             | --farbfeld          = also convert image to farbfeld
                -F             | --no-farbfeld       = do not convert to farbfeld
                -s micros      | --sleep micros      = after retrieving an image, wait for {micros}
microseconds
		-h             | --halfblock         = uses halfblock trick to double vertical resolution
		-H             | --no-halfblock      = use spaces for normal vertical resolution
		-S             | --no-sleep          = do not wait after retrieving an image
		-r             | --reapeat           = repeat downloading catgirls
		-R             | --no-repeat         = download only once, then exit
	Endpoint integration:
		This utility is designed to be able to retrieve most images from most APIs. To archieve this,
there should be a file that dictates which endpoints are usable and how to use them (config.def.h and
config.h).
	Shortest working build command:
		gcc main.c -lcurl -lcjson -ljpeg
		You probably want to also add -g, and then proceed to gdb ./a.out and waste and hour of your
life, because this was written across several days and there are probably bugs everywhere.
