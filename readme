A hopefully somewhat SUCKLESS utility inspired by the masterpieces "CatgirlDownloader" and "WaifuDownloader"
What this utility should do:
	Flags:
		-c count    | --count count       = retrieve {count} images
		-n          | --nsfw              = retrieve nsfw images
		-t tag      | --tag tag           = retrieve images with tag {tag}
		-e endpoint | --endpoint endpoint = retrieve from {endpoint}
	Endpoint integration:
		This utility is designed to be able to retrieve most images from most APIs. To archieve this,
there should be a file that dictates which endpoints are usable and how to use them.
